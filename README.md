# Maximizing Customer Retention by predicting the customer churn: (Capstone project)
Given the details on customersâ€™ orders and promotion emails sent, the task is to predict whether

customer churn rate, so that we can explain whether upsell or cross-selling of products improves 
the customer relationship.
